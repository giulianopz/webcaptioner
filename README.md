# Web Captioner

Web Captioner is a speech-to-text web service using the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) to transcribe microphone input in real time.

This is a stripped-down version of the original web service created by [Curt Grimes](https://curtgrimes.com/) who stopped maintaining Web Captioner on October 31, 2023, generously donating its source code to the community.
    
I resumed this app to offer its most valuable feature: a simple interface to the Web Speech API of Google Chrome for translating speech to text for free, optionally saving the transcript to a file.

This single feature is essential for many people, especially those who are deaf or hard of hearing because they have no other way to access precious contents on the web unless paying some expensive CART or Speech-to-Text services.
    
Any other features is temporarily disabled and I have no plans to restore them.

If you find Web Captioner useful, please find the time to say 'thank you' to its [author](mailto:contact@curtgrimes.com).

## Running the project

The bulk of the Web Captioner project (which was previously available at webcaptioner.com/captioner) is a [Vue 2](https://v2.vuejs.org/) / [Nuxt (version 2)](https://v2.nuxt.com/) app located under the `./app` folder. 

### Prerequisites

1. **Node v20.9.0** - This runs successfully with Node v20.9.0 (If you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) you can run `nvm install v20.9.0`).
1. **Python 2** - To build some dependencies you will need Python 2 available in your environment.

### Local development server

To run the Nuxt.js development server:

1. Clone this repository
1. Make sure you meet the [prerequisites above](#prerequisites)
1. `cd ./app`
1. Run `task install`
1. Run `task serve`
1. Load the website **in Google Chrome** at the path printed to the console.
1. You will need to update Chrome to treat your dev server as a secure origin in order for Chrome to allow you to grant the page the microphone permission:
   1. Type **chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure** in the address bar
   1. Copy and paste the dev server origin (something that looks like http://192.168.1.200:8080) into the text box.
   1. Click "Enable" next to the text box.
   1. Save and relaunch the browser.
