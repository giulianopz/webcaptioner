<h3 align="center">Web Captioner</h3>

<p align="center">A former speech-to-text app by <a href="https://curtgrimes.com">Curt Grimes</a>.</p>

# Web Captioner

Web Captioner was a speech-to-text service using the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) that existed at webcaptioner.com from 2017 until October 31, 2023.

## No longer maintained

**‚ö†Ô∏è This project is [no longer maintained](#development-history).** On October 31, 2023, I simultaneously sunset the project and released its source here. If you were a user of Web Captioner, your support over the years has been greatly appreciated!

I recommended exploring alternatives to Web Captioner which are better maintained and more fully featured, including built-in speech-to-text tools available on many of today's devices.

The release of this source code may lead to derivative versions of Web Captioner, over which I have no control, so use them at your own discretion.

## Features

- Provides a web interface for using the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) for speech-to-text conversion. Focused on Google Chrome support only.
- Provides a unique link to captions to display on other devices or in other applications (like in streaming applications that can embed a webpage). Requires [Redis server](#redis-server).
- Integrates with vMix, YouTube, FAB Subtitler, Dropbox, Zoom, and OBS Studio. Some integrations are incomplete or broken.
- Send captions to Chromecast devices.
- Configure speech recognition language (but no translation between languages).
- Configure the appearance of captions displayed on a screen.
- Configure word replacements for frequently misunderstood words.
- Export and restore configuration settings.
- Keyboard shortcuts for starting/stopping captions.
- Heuristics for "undoing" censorship applied by Google Chrome's implementation of the Web Speech API.
- Convert the output from the Web Speech API into a SRT file (experimental).

## Running the project

The bulk of the Web Captioner project (which was previously available at webcaptioner.com/captioner) is a [Vue 2](https://v2.vuejs.org/) / [Nuxt (version 2)](https://v2.nuxt.com/) app located under the `./app` folder. There are [earlier iterations](#development-history) that do not use Nuxt.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This project has outdated dependencies.** The most active development this project had was in 2017 through 2020, so there are now many outdated dependencies. Make sure you understand the security implications of running this as-is. I do not provide support.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node 12.2.0** - This runs successfully with Node 12.2.0 (If you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) you can run `nvm install 12.2.0`.) I have not verified compatibility with other Node versions, so it may work with other versions.
1. **Python 2** - To build some dependencies you will need Python 2 available in your environment. (If you are on a recent version of macOS that does not have Python 2 installed, here is [one way to install Python 2 on macOS](https://dev.to/jordicuevas/how-to-install-python2-in-a-macbook-m1-with-brew-bhi).)

### Local development server

To run the Nuxt.js development server:

1. Clone this repository
1. Make sure you meet the [prerequisites above](#prerequisites)
1. `cd ./app`
1. Run `npm i`
1. Copy the file `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in any env as necessary. (You can run a good portion of the project without filling in any.)
1. Run `npm run dev`
1. Load the website **in Google Chrome** at the path printed to the console.
1. You will need to update Chrome to treat your dev server as a secure origin in order for Chrome to allow you to grant the page the microphone permission:
   1. Type **chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure** in the address bar
   1. Copy and paste the dev server origin (something that looks like http://192.168.1.200:8080) into the text box.
   1. Click "Enable" next to the text box.
   1. Save and relaunch the browser.

### Docker

For those that are interested, there is an older [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (not used in more recent [iterations of Web Captioner](#development-history)) that could be used as a starting point for a more robust Dockerfile.

These commits at a much earlier point in the codebase where I was doing some Docker work might be helpful:

1. [cad70d18 - Dockerize app and add deployment to AWS](https://github.com/curtgrimes/webcaptioner/commit/cad70d18b5c93a15840c6397014dd1f999449604) (Dec 25, 2017)
1. [1ba6ceb4 - Add docker-compose file](https://github.com/curtgrimes/webcaptioner/commit/1ba6ceb4f2da357da1dbf3ca202f592676f8ee61) (Dec 26, 2017)

### Redis server

The ["share captions by link" feature](#share-captions-by-link-feature) requires a Redis server, but it could be reworked to not require it. If you have a Redis server to provide, update `REDIS_URL` in the `.env` file.

If you are not using this feature, you don't need the Redis server.

### Firebase

This project uses Firebase for user authentication ([Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)) and data storage ([Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)). Firebase can be configured with the `FIREBASE_*` environment variables listed in [.env.sample](./app/.env.sample).

Firestore had a "users" collection, and each user record had these properties:

- `settings` - values related to a user's preferences. The user could edit these things through the Web Captioner UI.
- `privileges` - some toggles for experimental features that I would change manually through the Firebase console on a per-user basis.

See [firestore-collection-example.json](./firestore-collection-example.json) for an example of what a user record looked like.
